# HW #2 – CRUSHING BUGS (TROUBLESHOOTING JAVASCRIPT)

## TODO:
Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were discovered in class. This is a research assignment - solve the problems outlined in the brief.

Create new branches (named appropriately) and update the func>onality to improve the game UX.

## Assignment Requirements
In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a >me.

The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.

Solve these two problems. You can use the original drop func>on to solve the first problem, and another func>on for the second. Try experimen>ng with calling one func>on from another - you might not need to add any event handling to solve these issues, just extend the func>onality.

Write out your plan FIRST. You can’t solve a problem - coding or otherwise - if you don’t understand what you need to do. Reason about the problem - think it through. Ar>cula>ng the solu>on first will be a great help in comple>ng the assignment successfully.

## Additional Requirements
1. Include a wriZen plan / path with your submission. Analyze the problem and provide the solu>on.
2. Create a Readme.md document for the repo with detailed informa>on about the project.
3. Create a branch for each bug and its solu>on. Provide the JS for each.
4. Merge everything to the master branch (keep all branches in your repo).
